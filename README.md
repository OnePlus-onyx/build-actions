# build-actions
If you often need to build android source code and find that disk space is limited or the Internet environment is too poor,  
if you are familiar with how to build android, build-android-actions can easily solve the problem.  

build-android-actions uses github-action and gdrive (enterprise edition) to reduce the burden on your machine and disk space.

## WHAT YOU NEED  

   only gdrive - enterprise

## Usage
- Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/ittat/build-actions/generate) button to create a new repository.
- Add the secrets of GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN in your new repository.
- Add rclone.conf as the secrets RCLONE to new repository.
- Open `.github/workflows/template_config.yml`
- Add device_name egï¼›`onyx`(oneplu x), `bacon`(oneplus one), `phhgsi_arm64_a`(phh's gsi) etc.
- Add build_device_tag: eg: `full-onyx-eng`, `full-bacon-userdebug` etc.
- Add repo_dispatches: `https://api.github.com/repos/(you id)/(you repo name)/dispatches`
- Add android_source: remote soucre address `"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-10.0.0_r41"`
- Mod ./android/source/fix_soucre.sh: add certain local_manifest about your target

## For example:

- Step 1 - `android/source/fix_soucre.sh`
```
## I want to build phh's gsi ROM so add relevant local_manifests
git clone https://github.com/phhusson/treble_manifest .repo/local_manifests  -b android-10.0
repo sync -c -j18 --force-sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle
```
- Step 2 - `.github/workflows/template_config.yml`
```
env:
  device_name: phhgsi_arm64_a
  build_device_tag: treble_arm64_avN-userdebug
  repo_dispatches: "https://api.github.com/repos/ittat-store/build-android-actions/dispatches"
  android_source: "https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-10.0.0_r41"
```

## Qusetions?
#### 1. Why select macos environment nor ubuntu?  
   Because the limited disk space in ubuntu that can't repo back all sources you need.  
   
#### 2. Why need gdrive and enterprise edition?
   Github Actions only get each job for 360 min which naturally can't achieve source in time (Android10).
   So I want to use a huge storage(more than 150G and gdrive enterprise edition is perfect) to save all source temporarily after each jobs. 
   
#### 3. Why need GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN?
   Start a new job after timeout
